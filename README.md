# UFOs

## Overview
Using Javascript to build a dynamic webpage and other customization tools that include Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. We took data stored as Javascript array and created a table to organize information relating to UFO sightings. To enhance the user experience we created a series of filters that will limit the view of the data based on the criteria entered. The filters search key data columns and are triggered as 'on change' events to further enhance the user experience.

## User Experience
The UFO Sightings page will load with all the data displaying in the dashboard.

By inputing in one or multiple of the filters will limit the data viewed on the dashboard. The filter criteria is Date, City, State, Country, and Shape of the UFO.

Here is an example of searching by City.

## Summary
While the user experience is good on this website there are some drawbacks and some improvements that could be made to make the experience better and more dynamic. The biggest drawback is that the data is static and would require manually updating to keep the sight current. By connecting the site to a live data feed, it would make the site timely and a perception of the place to go for the most current UFO sightings.

Secondarily, to improve upon the user experience we suggest make the filter functionality be changed to drop down menus that populate with the options to limit the data displayed on the dashboard. This would help it be more intuitive and would not require users to be already familiar with the data. Also with prior experience in using Google API, it would be nice to see a map for each entry to show where these sighting are happening in relation to each other.
